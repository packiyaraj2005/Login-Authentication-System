##Project Overview
This project is a fully responsive login system where users can register, log in, and log out securely. It focuses mainly on the frontend authentication flow, including form validation and session handling. Optionally, it can be connected to a backend for real user data verification and database integration.
The project demonstrates how a modern web application handles user authentication, ensuring a smooth user interface, responsive design, and basic session management features using LocalStorage (if backend is not used).

##Features
User-friendly login and signup interface
Frontend form validation (email, password strength, etc.)
Password visibility toggle
Alert or modal-based feedback for user actions
Option to simulate login using LocalStorage (no backend)
Responsive design for desktop and mobile
Optional backend integration for real-time authentication
Simple, minimal, and modern UI design

##Technologies Used (My Project Fully Focused on Frontend Only!)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend (Optional): Node.js / Express.js
Database (Optional): MySQL / MongoDB / Firebase

##Version Control: Git & GitHub
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone <your-repository-link>
cd login-authentication-system
(Optional) If backend is included:
npm install
npm start
Open index.html in your browser to view the project.

##Usage
Open the Login or Sign Up page
Enter user credentials and submit the form
The system validates inputs before submission
If using frontend only, credentials are simulated and stored locally
If backend is connected, credentials are verified on the server
After successful login, the user can access protected content or dashboard
(Optional) Backend Integration
Set up a Node.js or Express.js server

##Live demo
/signin ‚Üí To add new users
/login ‚Üí To verify user credentials
